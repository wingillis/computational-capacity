# computational-capacity

Exploring the relationship between network topology and computational capacity in constrained environments.

## Installation

- uv as package manager

## Initial goals

1. Build out the basic framework for the optimization problem.
2. Test optimization on simple problems.
3. Implement large-scale optimization.

### Building out the basic framework

The framework should consist of at least 3 modules:

1. A representation module: this handles the storage and manipulation of the network topology.
2. An optimization module: this handles optimizing topology. Examples: evolutionary algorithms, gradient-based approaches, etc.
3. A simulation module: this handles running tasks used in the optimization module. Examples: classification, pattern completion, memory.
